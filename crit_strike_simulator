'''
This  program will take 4 numbers as a format of xx.xx so eg: 22,78%
It will then will place all 4 digits in a 1-9 random number selector and
will create a list with those numbers eg: [2,2,7,8]

Each digit will be rolled individually 100 times and then an average is calculated.
My initial version didn't contain a round-up so it sometimes created results which
was deviating from the input value and so I added the myround function. 
I basically took that from the internet.

In time I wish to develop my own game with pixelart and I created this program to check how python can 
be used to produce critical strikes.


In my previous experiments I saw that a 1 to 9 randint produces pretty accurate values of expected percentages 
this is why I'm taking this method.

Comment: This program is working okay when we are not calculating critical strikes above 80%
Above 80% input the program will start producing some useless numbers.
